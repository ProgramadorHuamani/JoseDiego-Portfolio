# My personal website

Greetings everyone and welcome to the first version of my personal web site. My name is Jose Diego and I am a student of Software Engineering; the main reason why I came up with this project is mostly linked to share a little about my life both as a student and outside of it and to host my projects that I develop over time.

## What technologies or languages were used?

* __CSS__: It provides a semantic design to the HTML content structure and makes it more pleasing to the user's visual perspective.

* __JavaScript__: To add interactivity to the website and make it as eye-catching as possible.
